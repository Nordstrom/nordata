# Nordata

## Author:

## Introduction:
Nordata is a small collection of utility functions for accessing AWS S3 and AWS Redshift. It was written by a data scientist on the Nordstrom Analytics Team. The goal Nordata is to be a simple, robust package to ease data work-flow. It is not intended to handle every possible need (for example credential management is largely left to the user) but it is designed to streamline common tasks.

## Installing Nordata:
Nordata can be install via pip. As always, use of a project-level virtual environment is recommended.

 **Nordata requires Python >= 3.6.**

```bash
$ pip install nordata
```

## Setting up credentials for Nordata:

### Redshift:
Nordata is designed to ingest your Redshift credentials as an environment variable in the below format. This method allows the user freedom to handle credentials a number of ways. As always, best practices are advised. Your credentials should never be placed in the code of your project such as in a `Dockerfile` or `.env` file. Instead, you may wish to place them in your `.bash_profile` locally or take advantage of a key management service such as the one offered by AWS.

```bash
'host=my_hostname dbname=my_dbname user=my_user password=my_password port=1234'
```

### S3:
If the user is running locally, their `Home` directory should contain a `.aws/` directory with a `credentials` file. The `credentials` file should look similar to the example below where the profile name is in brackets. Note that the specific values and region may vary. If the user is running on an EC2, instance permission to access S3 is handled by the IAM role for the instance.

```bash
[default]
aws_access_key_id=MYAWSACCESSKEY
aws_secret_access_key=MYAWSSECRETACCESS
aws_session_token="long_string_of_random_characters=="
aws_security_token="another_string_of_random_characters=="
region=us-west-2
```

Note the the profile name in brackets. If the profile name differs in your credentials file, you will likely need to pass this profile name to the S3 functions as an argument.

## Testing:
For those interested in contributing to Nordata or forking and editing the project, pytest is the testing framework used. To run the tests, create a virtual environment, install the `dev-requirements.txt`, and run the following command from the root directory of the project. The testing scripts can be found in the test/ directory.

```bash
$ pytest
```
